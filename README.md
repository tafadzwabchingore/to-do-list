# Overview

This project is a simple command-line to-do list application built in TypeScript. The purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate my understanding of TypeScript, asynchronous programming, and user interaction through a CLI interface.

The software allows users to Add, Update, View, and Delete to-do items directly from the terminal. It leverages the inquirer library to handle user input and choices interactively, giving a practical experience of working with TypeScript types, arrays, and asynchronous functions.

The main purpose of writing this software was to improve my understanding of TypeScript syntax, asynchronous programming patterns (async/await), and modular program design in a real-world simulation.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The main editor used for writing and debugging the TypeScript code.

- Node.js & npm: Node.js provided the runtime environment to execute the code, while npm (Node Package Manager) was used to install dependencies like inquirer.

- TypeScript Compiler (tsc): Used to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript for execution in Node.js.

- Git & GitHub (optional): For version control and project management.

- Command Line / Terminal: Used to run the program and interact with the todo app.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

## Programming Language

TypeScript (TS):

-TypeScript was chosen because it provides static typing, class support, and better tooling compared to plain JavaScript.

-It also improves code maintainability and reduces runtime errors.

## Libraries

Inquirer.js:

- A popular Node.js library used to build interactive command-line interfaces (CLI).

- It allowed us to display menus, prompt users for input, and handle selections (like Add, Update, View, Delete, and Exit).

- This was crucial for making the Todo app user-friendly in the terminal.
