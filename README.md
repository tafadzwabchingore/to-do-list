# Overview

This project is a simple command-line to-do list application built in TypeScript. The purpose of this project is to explore and demonstrate my understanding of TypeScript, asynchronous programming, and user interaction through a CLI interface.

The software allows users to Add, Update, View, and Delete to-do items directly from the terminal. It leverages the inquirer library to handle user input and choices interactively, giving a practical experience of working with TypeScript types, arrays, and asynchronous functions.

The main purpose of writing this software was to improve my understanding of TypeScript syntax, asynchronous programming patterns (async/await), and modular program design in a real-world simulation.
